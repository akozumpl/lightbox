What Xfce is doing
==================

It creates an override_redirect gdk window over the whole sreen and sets the
darkened screenshot of the root window as the background. Then the spotlighted
dialog is displayed, but for everything to work it also needs to be
override_redirect and gets no window manager decorations. In fact the whole
window stacking just bombs and those are the only two visible windows (hm, that
is the point in fact).

Another caveat is that we have to play smart tricks with keyboard focus so the
user can not switch into another application. For that see
xfce4-session/xfce4-session/shutdown.c.
